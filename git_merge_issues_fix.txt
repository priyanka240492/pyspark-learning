Error-1:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
means that your Git repo doesn't yet have a remote named origin set up.

✅ To Fix It

You need to add the remote manually using:
git remote add origin <your-remote-repo-url>

Then push your main branch:
git push -u origin main

Error-2
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/priyanka240492/pyspark-learning.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

The remote repo on GitHub already has some commits (like a README.md or .gitignore) that your local branch doesn’t have, and Git is blocking the push to prevent overwriting them.

✅ To Fix This Safely

Step 1: Pull the remote changes first. This will merge the remote main into your local main:
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

--allow-unrelated-histories is needed if your local repo was initialized independently of the GitHub one.

You may be prompted to resolve a merge commit — just save and exit the editor if asked.

Step 2: Push your local branch again:
git push -u origin main
